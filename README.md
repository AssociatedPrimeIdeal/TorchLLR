# Locally Low-Rank Reconstruction implemented PyTorch

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch 
- NumPy

## Usage
The 'recon_GPU_release.py' script will perform the LLR reconstruction on a default all-one matrix, which requires approximately 42GB of GPU memory. You can modify the script to use your own csm and k-space data.
